        <h1>A Brute-force NBody Approach to Modeling Gravity</h1>
        <h2><i>August 16, 2022</i></h2>
        <p>
            <i>Edit: July 13, 2023: This project was created due to my 
            interest in the alluring and beautiful work of using large astrophysical models
            to understand the Universe. Although I still find these models fascinating, my primary 
            focus has long been towards remote sensing and planetary science.</i>
        </p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            For this project, I don't intend to go in-depth on the specifics of the code. If there 
            are any questions about how to do this yourself, visit my GitHub or feel free to contact
            me. I've chosen to use CUDA (NVIDIA's parallel programming language) for its documentation and widespread use
            and OpenGL (for displaying the particles). 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am most interested in
            explaining the physics that underlie the algorithm used in this project and providing you 
            with some short clips demonstrating the application in all its glory. So, as a teaser, 
            here's a little clip of what I've got going at the moment:
        </p>

        <p>
            I know I'm biased, but that looks pretty cool to me. Okay, without further ado, let's get 
            into the simulation. The only equation needed to understand how the program operates is Newton's 
            law of universal gravitation: 
        </p>
        <p>
            \begin{equation}F=G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}\end{equation}
        </p>
        <p>
            This equation simply states that two objects of masses m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> exert a force on each other that 
            is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of 
            the distance between them. G refers to the gravitational constant, which is 6.674×10<sup>-11</sup> m<sup>3</sup>⋅kg<sup>-1</sup>⋅s<sup>-2</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Luckily, we aren't actually interested in the force acting on each body, but rather the acceleration of each body 
            due to said forces because this will allow us to determine the particle's positions as a function of time. Thanks to the equation, 
        </p>
        <p>
            \begin{equation}a=\frac{F}{m}\end{equation}
        </p>
        <p>
            the first equation can be simplified to
        </p>
        <p>
            \begin{equation}a_1=G\frac{m_2}{r^2}\end{equation}
        </p>
        <p>
            This equation is the basis for updating particle positions over time.
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Code</h2>
        <p>
            Here, I used what is known as "Euler's method" for solving for the position of each particle. Put simply, the function which describes 
            the changing position of each particle is a differential equation which uses infinitesimally small time increments to compute a finite 
            change in position over a finite time interval. By using Euler's method, a finite timestep is used. Thus, one could imagine a particle 
            which is experiencing some gravitational acceleration. Using Euler's method, that acceleration will be assumed to be constant for the 
            entire duration of the timestep. In reality the particle experiences a continuously changing acceleration. Euler's method is thus a first-order
            approximation, and a small delta time should be used to minimize inaccuracies. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Worse yet, I applied a "brute-force" method with this application. By this I mean that the acceleration of each particle is computed by 
            determining the distance to every other particle. In other words, if you have a simulation with 40,000 particles, each one of those particles must 
            compute the acceleration due to gravity from all 39,999 other particles and sum them up to provide the final acceleration for that time step. 
            Although this is the physically accurate way to perform the task,
            it is by no means the most efficient method to perform this simulation, and I may explore alternatives like the Barnes-Hut algorithm in a
            future project.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first step was to create two shared memory buffers consisting of float3 arrays. These buffers contain the position and velocity data that 
            will be used to provide the initial conditions for the simulation for each time step as well as for coloring the particles based on their speed. 
            The buffers are passed to a CUDA kernel where they begin to do their magic. First, an initialization kernel sets the position of each particle 
            based on its CUDA thread and block indices. Then the physics kernel loops over all particles and calculates the distance between them and 
            the current particle in the threadblock. Because each particle's position consists of an x, y, and z value, this is achieved using the equation:
        </p>
        <p>
            \begin{equation}r = \sqrt{(n_{ix} - n_{jx})^2+(n_{iy} - n_{jy})^2+(n_{iz} - n_{jz})^2}\end{equation}
        </p>
        <p>
            Which is just the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions. I simplified my life by making all bodies in this simulation the same mass. 
            By doing this, I can compute the acceleration due to any body using equation 3 without needing another buffer to store mass data. After computing 
            the magnitude of the acceleration, the x, y, and z components of acceleration can be computed by using the equation:
        </p>
        <p>
            \begin{equation}\vec{a}=\biggr{\langle}{|\vec{a}|\biggr{(}\frac{\vec{r_x}}{|\vec{r}|}\biggr{)}},{|\vec{a}|\biggr{(}\frac{\vec{r_y}}{|\vec{r}|}\biggr{)}},{|\vec{a}|\biggr{(}\frac{\vec{r_z}}{|\vec{r}|}\biggr{)}}\biggr{\rangle}\end{equation}
        </p>
        <p>
            This equation is based on the idea that an object will accelerate along the vector pointing towards another object. 
            If you divide the x, y, and z components of this direction vector by the magnitude of the distance, you get a unit vector which, when multiplied by the 
            magnitude of the acceleration, gives you a three dimensional vector representing the acceleration of the particle. By summing the acceleration 
            vectors together from all other particles, a final net acceleration vector is returned.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, in order to convert the calculated acceleration values into a new position, we have to integrate the velocity with respect to time. Velocity is given by:
        </p>
        <p>
            \begin{equation}v = v_0 + at\end{equation}
        </p>
        <p>
            We calculate the velocity of the particle by multiplying the net acceleration by our fixed timestep and adding it to the initial velocity.
            By integrating this function, we arrive at the equation relating position to this value: 
        </p>
        <p>
            \begin{equation}p=\int{v_0 + at}\hspace{0.25em}dt=v_0t+\frac{1}{2}vt^2+p_0\end{equation}
        </p>
        <p>
            Where <i>p</i> and <i>p<sub>0</sub></i> are the updated and initial positions, respectively. <i>p</i> is then used as the final position of the particle! The velocity buffer is also
            updated in the process with the new velocity values.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, in each timestep, for each particle, the acceleration is calculated, the velocity is updated based on this acceleration acting over a fixed timestep,
            and the position is updated based on this velocity acting over the same fixed timestep. This process is repeated for each cycle, and the result is the illusion
            of continuous motion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The velocity was used in the vertex shader to compute color values for each particle. Particles which have greater velocities have a bluer color.

        <p>
            Wow, this project took me longer than I care to admit, and was in large part an effort to just learn better programming.
            Overall, although the code may be messy, I'm pretty happy with the results: Here's some beautiful simulations.
